Our work was published in 《IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)》 and 《IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT)》 successively. We take the CNN model proposed in the journal as our final open source model. The code is implemented through pytorch.

In addition, we open source our own data sets.
