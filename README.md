Our work was published in 《IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)》 and 《IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT)》 successively. We take the CNN model proposed in the journal as our final open source model. The code is implemented through pytorch.

In addition, we open source our own datasets. The dataset contains 177 sets of static scene exposure sequences taken by Cannon5D4 camera, each sequence contains the results of 7 shots, with an exposure interval of 1eV and ISO of 800. In order to advance the research in the field of raw images, all the original files after shooting are preserved.Specifically, it contains CR2 files, JPEG files, and detailed shooting parameters contained in the file ownership information. The training set, validation set and test set for this task are obtained by sampling the original files.

The download address and preprocessing code for the dataset can be downloaded from the following link:

It is worth noting that the application domain of this data set is not limited to single-shot HDRI tasks.
